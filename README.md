# Room_Reservation--Python-Django-Generic_Views
The Room Reservation System is a complete solution for displaying information and the occupancy status of rooms. It is a simple and intuitive tool for effective management of office space resources.


In the project, I did not focus on the aspect of the visual layer because the back end was the most important to me.
It is a simple application based on the Django framework and a simple database.

In this project, I focused on the possibilities of generic views offered by the Django framework.
